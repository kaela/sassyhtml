I’m Kaela. I work for a super fun fashion company in LA. 

sassyhtml.com is my reference guide for information I could not find within the the first five results of my Google searching. Yes, I am that lazy. 

Feel free to copy me, or rewrite my stuff and make it better.

## The name, "sassyhtml"

The very basic part of each website is the html. It’s our job to make it go from bland to a brand. It’s our job to make it sassy.

## This site uses...

* Jekyll
* Github
* HTML/md
* CSS (SCSS)
