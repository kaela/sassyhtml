I just found my favorite to-do list organization. It’s inside of GitHub issues and can also be used as a subtask. It’s so perfect. So elegant. And so, so simple.

### Here’s what you do…
1. Open a GitHub issue
2. In your description, type `- [ ]`. In case you didn’t get that, it’s dash-space-bracket-space-bracket.

And that’s it. When you check off a task item, the checkmark (or unselection of a checkmark) persists. GitHub even adds this handy-dandy task completion status on the issue itself:
